# 🦀 Rust Development Roadmap

Rust is a modern language built for performance and safety, often used for systems programming, game engines, and web assembly. This roadmap breaks down the key concepts with mini-projects to practice along the way.

## 🏁 Phase 1: Rust Fundamentals (1–2 Weeks)

### 1. **Getting Started with Rust**
   - 🚀 Install Rust with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
   - Run `rustc --version` to check your setup.
   - 🎥 [Beginner Rust Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw)

### 2. **Basic Syntax and Data Types**
   - 🧩 Learn `let` statements, data types (integers, floats, booleans).
   - **Ownership & Borrowing**: Rust’s core memory safety principles.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Create a *basic calculator* that takes user input for different operations.

### 3. **Control Flow (if, match, loops)**
   - 🎥 [Rust Control Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKfLNPtmYh8)
   - Use `if`, `match`, and loops (`for`, `while`) for control flow.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Build a *number guessing game* that provides hints.

## 📚 Phase 2: Intermediate Rust (2–3 Weeks)

### 1. **Functions and Modules**
   - 🎥 [Functions & Modules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQhEyKhYZOk)
   - Define functions, understand scopes, and split code with modules.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Create a *temperature converter* with functions and modules.

### 2. **Structs and Enums**
   - 🎥 [Understanding Structs & Enums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBpzsLIQyb8)
   - Use `structs` to group data and `enums` for variant types.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Build a *basic library app* to manage books with structs.

### 3. **Error Handling with Result and Option**
   - 🎥 [Error Handling in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3E0rrk4zRA)
   - Use `Result` and `Option` for error handling without exceptions.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Add error handling to your library app for checking invalid inputs.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Advanced Rust Concepts (2–3 Weeks)

### 1. **Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes**
   - 🎥 [Ownership in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GvSKBET0A)
   - Deepen understanding of Rust’s memory safety with borrowing and lifetimes.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Implement a *text parser* that reads and parses file content safely.

### 2. **Traits and Generics**
   - 🎥 [Traits & Generics in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyFMmFYbvxg)
   - Create reusable code with generics and define shared behavior with traits.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Build a *generic stack data structure* that stores multiple types.

### 3. **Concurrency with Threads and Channels**
   - 🎥 [Rust Concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOE8whj44P4)
   - Implement concurrency with threads, and communicate using channels.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Create a *multi-threaded downloader* that downloads files in parallel.

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Rust for Real Projects (Ongoing)

### 1. **Rust with WebAssembly**
   - 🎥 [Rust & WebAssembly Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsD0NpFSADM)
   - Compile Rust to WebAssembly to run it in the browser.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Build a simple *calculator web app* using Rust and WebAssembly.

### 2. **Building CLI Tools**
   - 🎥 [Command-Line Apps in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsUOPcUt4As)
   - Use crates like `clap` and `structopt` to build CLI tools.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Create a CLI tool that manages to-do lists.

### 3. **Integrating Rust with Other Languages**
   - 🎥 [Rust with C/C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjE76VT8DuQ)
   - Learn how to use Rust for performance-critical parts of applications alongside C/C++.

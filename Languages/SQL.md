# 🚀 SQL Language Development Roadmap

SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for querying and managing data in relational databases. This roadmap covers SQL basics, advanced querying, database design, and optimization, helping you unlock powerful data analysis skills.

## 🏁 Phase 1: SQL Basics (1 Week)

### 1. **Getting Started with SQL**
   - Learn what SQL is and its role in managing data.
   - Set up a database environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
   - 🎥 [Intro to SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY)

### 2. **Basic SQL Commands**
   - Learn to use `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.
   - Filter data, sort results, and understand basic query structures.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Retrieve and sort *product data* from a sample database.

### 3. **Using Aggregate Functions**
   - Practice with functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.
   - 🎥 [Aggregate Functions in SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxFgWbG-ZLk)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Generate *sales summaries* for a store database.

## 🔗 Phase 2: Intermediate SQL (1–2 Weeks)

### 1. **Joining Tables**
   - Learn different types of joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
   - 🎥 [SQL Joins Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HVMiPPuPIM)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Combine *customer and order data* using joins.

### 2. **Group By and Having Clauses**
   - Use `GROUP BY` for aggregation and `HAVING` to filter groups.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Create reports on *total sales by region* using grouping.

### 3. **Subqueries**
   - Write subqueries to perform nested queries and filter results.
   - 🎥 [SQL Subqueries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVT0FN6pWYU)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Create a *top customer report* using subqueries.

## 📊 Phase 3: Advanced SQL (2–3 Weeks)

### 1. **Window Functions**
   - Master functions like `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, and `NTILE`.
   - 🎥 [Window Functions in SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDqMp8vFlAY)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Calculate *running totals* and *rank sales data* by region.

### 2. **Complex Joins and Self Joins**
   - Perform joins on the same table and write complex queries.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Analyze *employee hierarchy data* with self joins.

### 3. **Stored Procedures and Functions**
   - Create stored procedures and functions to automate queries.
   - 🎥 [Stored Procedures in SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzqLgNkBaJ4)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Develop a *stored procedure to automate monthly reports*.

## 🧰 Phase 4: Database Design and Optimization (2–3 Weeks)

### 1. **Normalization and Denormalization**
   - Understand data normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and when to denormalize.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Design a *normalized database schema* for an e-commerce application.

### 2. **Indexing and Performance Optimization**
   - Learn to use indexes for faster querying and optimize queries.
   - 🎥 [SQL Indexing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3b2fL3qQ2A)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Optimize *slow queries* in a large sample dataset.

### 3. **Transactions and Concurrency Control**
   - Use transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) and understand ACID properties.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Implement *transactions in an inventory management system*.

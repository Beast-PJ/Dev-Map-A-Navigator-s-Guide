### 2. **Basic Syntax and Variables**
   - Learn basic data types (numeric, character, logical, etc.).
   - Practice with vectors, lists, and factors.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Create a *simple calculator* that performs basic arithmetic operations.

### 3. **Control Flow: Conditionals and Loops**
   - Master `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while` loops.

## 📊 Phase 2: Data Manipulation and Analysis (2–3 Weeks)

### 1. **Data Frames and Data Manipulation**
   - Work with data frames: create, subset, and transform.
   - Use packages like `dplyr` for data manipulation.
   - 🎥 [Data Manipulation with dplyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSopAHvYej8)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Analyze a *dataset on population statistics* using data frames and `dplyr`.

### 2. **Data Cleaning with Tidyverse**
   - Learn to clean and prepare data using the `tidyverse` package.
   - Handle missing data, reshape data, and merge datasets.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Clean a *dataset with missing values and outliers* using `tidyverse`.

### 3. **Data Visualization with ggplot2**
   - Use `ggplot2` to create bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and more.
   - 🎥 [Data Visualization with ggplot2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oIjsnARsJA)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Visualize a *dataset on global temperatures* over time.

## 📈 Phase 3: Statistical Analysis (2–3 Weeks)

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Calculate mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
   - Generate summary statistics for datasets.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Perform a *descriptive analysis on a dataset* of product sales.

### 2. **Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals**
   - Conduct t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.
   - Learn about confidence intervals and p-values.
   - 🎥 [Hypothesis Testing in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGPG_xUgAHk)
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Analyze *customer satisfaction data* and test hypotheses.

### 3. **Regression Analysis**
   - Perform linear and logistic regression.
   - Interpret coefficients and make predictions.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Build a *linear regression model* to predict housing prices.

## 🤖 Phase 4: Machine Learning in R (2–3 Weeks)

### 1. **Introduction to Machine Learning in R**
   - Learn the basics of machine learning.
   - Use libraries like `caret` for machine learning workflows.

### 2. **Supervised Learning Models**
   - Build and evaluate models like decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Predict *customer churn* using a decision tree model.

### 3. **Unsupervised Learning Models**
   - Explore clustering techniques like K-means and hierarchical clustering.
   - 🛠️ **Mini Project**: Cluster *customer segments* based on purchasing behavior.
